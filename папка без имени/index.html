                Statistically speaking, the earth's temperature is rising every year. If in January 2015 the average temperature was 20.6, in 2023 the temperature rised to 20.85.<b>Heat waves are becoming more common, and intense heat waves are more frequent in the world </b>. Which mean that every year the heat waves are growing very fast. </big>
             <h2> What does heat waves mean? </h2>
            <big> A heat wave is a period of unusually <b>hot weather</b>. To be considered a heat wave, the temperatures have to be outside the historical averages for a given area. In other words, itâ€™s when the weather gets exceptionally hot and stays that way for an extended period. </big>
            <h2> How heat waves are formed? </h2>
            <big>Heat waves result from the interaction of factors of different nature. In recent years, <b>global warming</b> has been a key factor making heat waves more frequent and intense in most regions of the world.</big>
            <h2>Threats Posed by Extreme Heat</h2>
            <big>Heat waves have a significant impact on the <b>environment</b>. Here is how it happens: 
 
                <li> <b>Evaporation of water bodies:</b> High temperatures cause water bodies to evaporate rapidly, which can cause drought and impair access to water resources. </li>
                <li> <b>Damage to ecosystems:</b> Ecosystems become vulnerable. High temperatures can affect wildlife, plants and animals. </li>
                <li> <b>Wildfire risk: Heat waves increase the likelihood of wildfires due to dryness and high temperatures</b> </li></big>
        
            <h2>Human health</h2>
        
            <big>Heat waves can have serious effects on <b>human health</b>. Here are some of them:                                                                        
        
                <li><b>Heat Stroke:</b> This is a condition where the body temperature rises to dangerous levels due to prolonged exposure to high temperatures. Symptoms include headache, heavy sweating, weakness and even loss of consciousness.  </li>      
                <li> <b>Dehydration:</b> During a heat wave, the body rapidly loses moisture through sweat. This can lead to dehydration, which is dangerous to your health.                  </li>  
                <li>  <b>Respiratory problems:</b> High temperatures can degrade air quality, which can affect breathing.                   </li>        </big>
        <h2>Resilience for extreme heat</h2>
            <big>Adapting to heat waves is essential to <b>protect human health</b> and reduce negative effects. Here are some tips:</big>
        
        <big>    <li><b>Stay cool:</b> </li>
            <ol start="1" >  
                <li>Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun.</li>
                <li>    Use an air conditioner or fan.    </li> </ol>
            <li><b>Drink enough water:</b> Dehydration can be dangerous. Drink water regularly. </li>
            <li> <b>Cool off:</b> 
    <ol start="1">  
        <li>Use wet towels on your body. </li>   
        <li>Take cool showers or baths.  </li> </ol> </big>
        
            <h2> Enviroment</h2>
        <big> Adaptation to climate change is an important step towards a sustainable future for cities. Here are a few ways cities are paying attention to adapting to hot conditions:
            <li> <b>Increasing green spaces:</b> Planting more trees and creating green spaces on walls and roofs helps cool cities. Green spaces absorb heat and create a pleasant microclimate      </li>
            <li> <b>Blue infrastructure:</b> Creating water features such as fountains, ponds and rivers helps to cool cities. Water absorbs heat and creates a pleasant microclimate             </li>
            <li> <b>Use of cool materials:</b> Introducing materials that reflect sunlight and do not heat up as much can help reduce temperatures in cities. This includes green roofs, reflective roofs and cool road surfaces               </li>  </big>
 
            <h2> There are a few examples of cities that are innovating to fight the heat:</h2>
           <img src="images/Singapur.webp" alt="picture 2" style="float:left; margin-right:5px;" width="35%" align="center" width="30%" /> 
           <img src="images/000.jpg" alt="picture 3" align="center" width="33%" width="30%" />
           <img src="images/portu.jpg" alt="picture 4" width="30%" width="33%" align="center" />
            <big> <li> The first one is Singapore. Singapure is making extensive use of green roofs, vertical gardens and rooftop parks. This helps to cool the city environment and improve air quality. </li> 
                <li>  The second one is Melbourne .Melbourne has introduced a 'Green Roof Strategy', encouraging building owners to install green roof coverings. This reduces the heat load and mitigates the climate. </li>    
            <li>The third one is Porto. The city has created the "Green Corridor", a network of green spaces, parks and gardens to help reduce temperatures and improve the comfort of citizens.</li>

        <p> <big> Coming to the conclusion we can say that heat waves are an interesting topic in climate change research. They can cause negative effects on humans and the environment, but also positive effects. It is important to develop adaptation strategies to deal more effectively with their negative effects </big>                                                </p>
